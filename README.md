# Kibana Dashboard Demo
This repository contains some sample dashboards created for Apache Web Logs collected from [secrepo.com](https://secrepo.com)

To use these dashboards, you will need to do the following:

1. Use the following mappings (you know to get the GeoIP etc formatted correctly)
2. Ingest Apache Access logs to Elasticsearch (through filebeats, logstash or even data visualiser uploads)
3. Import the Kibana objects to your Kibana Instance

Please let me know if you have any questions through issues in this repo. Thanks!
